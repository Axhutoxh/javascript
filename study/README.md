# Javascript

- JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

## Why Study Javascript ?

- JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

  1.  HTML to define the content of web pages

  2.  CSS to specify the layout of web pages

  3.  JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
