# Javascript

- JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

## Why Study Javascript ?

- JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

  1.  HTML to define the content of web pages

  2.  CSS to specify the layout of web pages

  3.  JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

# How JavaScript Works

- JavaScript is a multi-paradigm prototype-based language, which uses JavaScript Engine such as Chromeâ€™s V8 engine Firefox SpiderMonkey engine and etc. They convert the high level code into machine-readable code which lets computer to perform some specific tasks. We will understand this using an image..

## Js Engine Architecture

### Google chromeâ€™s JavaScript V8 engine

Firstly, raw JavaScript file goes into the Parser.

1. <b>Parser</b> : <i> It checks for syntax and semantics. Parser is nothing but a lexical analysis that results into the breaking of code into tokens in order to understand their meanings and these tokens gets converted into Abstract Syntax Tree(AST). </i>

2. <b>Abstract Syntax tree</b> : <i>It is a hierarchical tree like structure of program representation which allows interpreter to understand the program. This AST is initially goes to the Interpreter. </i>

3. <b>Interpreter</b> :<i>It lets the AST to get converted into Byte code. In V8 engine, this process is known as Ignition but when some code gets repeated again and again. </i>

4. <b>Profiler</b> :<i> It will check for the repeating code that can be optimized. As soon as, it gets the repeating code, it basically moves the code into compiler. </i>

5. <b>Compiler</b> :<i> It spits out the most optimized byte code. In V8 Engine, This compiler is called as TurboFan. This process gets repeated again and again which means that JavaScript Engineâ€™s speed gets improved since profiler and compiler will be producing and updating the optimized byte code. </i>
